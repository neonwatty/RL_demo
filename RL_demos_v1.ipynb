    "\n",
    "The two major areas where RL is currently applied are in automatic control (and robotics in particular) and in video / board game AI.  Here we introduce a variety of common RL problems that we will return to as we go deeper into details.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 1:  Grid world: making a shortest-path finding AI\n",
    "\n",
    "Grid world is a simplified version of what is called the shortest path problem - a problem often solved in video games (this is how enemy AI units find you in the game), mapping services (finding the shortest route from A to B), and robot path planning (e.g., for a cleaning robot) - get a user from its starting location to a desired destination in as few steps as possible.    \n",
    "\n",
    "There are many algorithms specifically designed to solve just this task - the most popular being [Dijkstra’s and A* algorithms](http://www.redblobgames.com/pathfinding/a-star/introduction.html).  However here we will use the flexible RL framework as it too provides great results, and the (relative) simplicity of the problem will allow us to illustrate the more general RL learning process hopefully clearly.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this toy problem we have a grid like the one illustrated below.  Each square tile is a location in the world.  Here the black square denotes the user, the green square the desired destination, and the blue squares impenetrable obstacles (the user cannot move to).  \n",
    "\n",
    "The actions available to our user are to move one unit left, right, up, or down and it can move to any free square (here colored grey) any hazard square (think hot coals! shown in orange) and the goal (colored green).  If the user ever moves to the goal square the game is over."

    "\n",
    "**There are *four* main components to the RL model: states, features, actions, and rewards.**  We will talk about the first 3 now, and deal with features in the next section.  So the first three main concepts are - at a high level:\n",
    "\n",
    "1\\.    A **state** is a specific configuration of all objects in a problem's enviroment.  A **state space** is the collection of all possible states this enviroment is capable of producing.  The state space is defined by the problem we aim to solve.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In *grid world* any state consists of one piece of information: the current location of the player (the black square).  The state space is all possible locations on the board where the player can go.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the chess problem a state is any (legal) configuration of the white and black pieces on the board (and some pieces may be missing).  The state space is the set of all possible configurations of chess pieces on the board.  The state space is defined by the problem we aim to solve.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the cart-pole problem a state is a complete set of information about the cart and pole's position.  This includes: the cart position, the cart velocity, the angle of the pole measured as its deviation from the vertical position, and the angular velocity of the pole.  While these are technically continuous values, in practice they are finelly discretized.  The state does **not** include technical / physical information about the enviroment e.g., the fact that gravity exists, its precise force, etc.,\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2\\.  The agent can then take an **action** - the set of actions is either determined by us or by the problem environment.  The **action space** is the total set of such available actions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- For grid world, a toy problem, we can choose a set of actions.  For example we could decide that the agent can only move the black square adjacently one unit up/down/left/right or keep it still.  Alternatively, we could allow the agent to move the black square diagonally as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the chess problem an action is a legal move of any of its current pieces on the board.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the cart pole problem - as in robotics applications as well - the range of actions is completely defined by the available range of motions of the machine being directly controlled.  In cart pole the agent directly controls the cart, which in 2-dimensions can only move left or right.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3\\.  Once this action is taken the agent receives a **reward** - or a signal that the agent has performed a good or bad action based on our desired goal.  We (humans) decide on the reward structure (in order to induce our agent to accomplish our desired goal).  We want a reward for a given action to be **larger** for those actions that get us closer to accomplishing our goal (and less for those actions which do not), or vice versa.  To reiterate: this is the (only) way we communicate our desired goal to the agent.\n",

However these exact numbers are arbitrary, so long as a negative reward is given to actions not directly leading to the goal (and a positive reward is given when the goal square is reached).\n",

    "Not all problems are 'deterministic' in nature, such as those considered here.  That is one realized action $a_k$ at a given state $s_{k-1}$ always leads to the same next state $s_k$.  In *stochastic* problems a given action at a state may lead to different conclusions.  For example robotics RL-based problems are often stochastic in nature - e.g., a robot may perform a given action - like accelerate forward one unit of thrust - at the a state and reach different outcomes due to things like inconsistencies in the application of this action, sensor issues, or friction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Almost the same modeling we used above captures this variability for such stochastic problems, with the main difference being that the reward function must also necessarily be a function of the state $s_k$ as well $a_k$ and $s_{k-1}$.  We won't deal with this generality until we flush out all the details of the deterministic scenario first."

    "\n",
    "### Choosing features that provide the best information about your problem states\n",
    "\n",
    "Many machine learning problems require that you know a substantial amount of information about a given domain in order to make a proper choice of features.  You obviously do not want features that represent your data incorrectly, as if you use such features no algorithm on earth can help you solve your problem.  In two class classification - for example - if you choose features that cause your classes to completely intermix you won't be able to perform your task very well.\n",
    "\n",
    "This intuition carries over to the RL setting as well.  Generally speaking the same holds in the RL setting as well.  If you are working on a complex robotics problem your time spent engineering features could be substantial.  Analog to classification, in the RL setting you want features that sharply distinguish between *states* of your system.  If your features fail to accomplish this you will train a poorly performing agent.  And designing features that accomplish this goal can require serious reflection and work.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For some RL problems - however - choosing reasonable features is fairly intuitive.  In the toy problems we discussed here - for example - choosing features was straight forward (sometimes we just took the raw state itself as the feature).  In other game related problems the choice can be more intuitive as well - but the more you understand the game the better the features you can devise.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The information content of features vs cost of simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "With typical machine learning problems you don't want your features to misrepresent your data (the worst case scenario), but you also don't want the to be uninformative (a milder problem).  Uninformative features don't mess up your data - e.g., in the two class classification scenario they don't mix up your two classes - but **the less informative your features are the more data you need to determine your system's underlying rule**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same holds for the RL scenario - with one important wrinkle: with RL problems you *create your own dataset* in learning the $Q$ function properly.  So you can get away with having fairly uninformative features if you have the computational power to compensate for them, and run a very large number of epislodes.  This is certainly possible with a problems like the chess or cart pole examples - we can simulate until the cows come home using e.g., a cloud server.  The cost of simulating is low.  This is not the case for many robotics applications however, where an episode must be enacted by a physical robot (hence limiting the number of episodes we can effectively run).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Choosing features based on a product or research goal\n",
    "\n",
    "Another question to consider when choosing features for RL is: what are your intentions?  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Are they practical?  Do you want to produce a robot with some automatic control feature and sell it to paying customers?  Then you want invest heavily in resources to construct a set of features that will work quickly and effectively with your application.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Are they research-focused?  Then your goal may be set by a curiousity of your own or an academic or industry establishment.  One academic question investigated a lot these days is to find a set of features you can effectively apply to solving a large set of visual problems (e.g., convolutional networks for training Atari AI).  These features are not very informative, but because computer power and storage is so great these days we can make these features work by running a very large number of episodes to learn $Q$ properly."

Because rememver that in order to learn the $Q$ function we have to be able to cycle through *every possible state*.  Practically speaking then even a state space of size $10^{120}$ is far too large for us to be able to learn a representative $Q$ effectively.  \n",
